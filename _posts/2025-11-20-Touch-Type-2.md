I'm about 6 weeks in. 

I haven't quite been hitting the daily quota, but I haven't quit either.
TW: the word finger is used a lot here.

## Stats

Average typing speed about 30 words per minute sounds bad. But I can see the progress!

## Learning

### Ouchies

I will rate the physical and mental pain progress of each step so far.

- Step 1. Resting on the home keys. 2/5 ouchies.
- Step 2. Beginner letters: **A E I L N R**

  - Using the left pinky for **A** was challenging. 3/5 ouchies.
  - Bending right index finger to reach **N** on the bottom row was tricky. 5/5 ouchies.
 
    - I immediately felt demoralised. But fast-forward a few lessons and I could easily reach the key.
- Step 3. Danger Here: **T**

    - Delight after unlocking **T** was short-lived. Struggled reaching over with left index finger to hit **T**. 5/5 ouchies
    - It took more than double the number of lessons to unlock the next letter. Tough going.

- Step 4: On A Roll: **O S**

    - The trickiest part to **O** was I think more getting used to the straight finger movement because of the columnar keyboard layout. 3/5 ouchies.
    - **S** started badly but unlocked the next letter quick enough. 4/5 ouchies.

- Step 5. Are **U** Serious?
    
    - This took forever to get past. Mental barrier this time, carried over form the 'hunt and peck' typing style I think. 5/5 ouchies.
    - It's interesting how you think you have mastered some letters, but introducing a new section of the keyboard to us completely fecks you over. 
      **I** and **E** tok a nosedive here.

- Step 6 and beyond. Are we there yet?

  -  **D** weirdly another mental struggle. 4/5 
  -  **Y** 0/5 ouchies
  -  **C** absolute nightmare, but I knew after all previous nightmares that it would be grand. 5/5 ouchies.
  -  **G** 2/5 ouchies, in general the left hand keys have been harder to grasp.
  -  **H** 0/5 ouchies.


## Some catchy heading here

So far it has been a challenge, but I feel confident that I can master this jazz soon enough.
Slow and steady wins the race. Sometimes.
