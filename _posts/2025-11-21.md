I’m about 6 weeks in.

I haven’t quite been hitting the daily quota, but I haven’t quit either.  
**TW:** the word *finger* is used a lot here.

Stats
-----

An average typing speed of about **30 words per minute** sounds bad… but I can definitely see the progress.

### Ouchies

I will rate the physical and mental pain of each step so far.

#### 🏠 Step 1. Resting on the home keys

**Ouchies:** 😖😖

#### 🚀 Step 2. Beginner letters: A E I L N R

**Ouchies:** 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️

- Using the left pinky for **A** was challenging.
- Bending my right index finger to reach **N** was rough.
    - I felt instantly demoralised… but a few lessons later, it was fine.

#### 🤏 Step 3 — Danger Here: T

**Ouchies:** 😖😖😖😖😖

- The delight of unlocking **T** was short-lived.
- It took more than double the number of lessons to unlock the next letter. Tough going.

#### 🔠 Step 4 — On a Roll: O, S

**Ouchies:** 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️

- **O** was mostly weird because of the straight finger movement.
- **S** started badly but unlocked the next letter quickly.

#### 💀 Step 5 — Are U Serious?

**Ouchies:** 😖😖😖😖😖

- **U** took *forever*. A full-on mental block from my old hunt-and-peck habits.
- It's interesting how you think you've mastered some letters, until introducing a new section of the keyboard completely fecks you over.  
    **I** and **E** took a nosedive here.

#### 🧗 Step 6 &amp; beyond. Are we there yet?

- **D** — weirdly another mental struggle 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
- **Y** — suspiciously fine 😖
- **C** — an absolute nightmare 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
- **G** — not too bad 😖😖 (in general, the left hand has been harder)
- **H** — no major issues 🌶️

The Final Boss: The Whole Keyboard
----------------------------------

So far, it’s been challenging, but I’m confident I’ll have this (🌰 nut??) cracked soon enough.

Slow and steady wins the race.

Sometimes.
