I'm Hazel. I'm from Ireland and have been working as a **Software Engineer** since 2016.

### Non Tech Things I like

- Music - I will listen to any genre with the exception of.. Irish Country.
- Sports - I love watching most sports, especially:
  - Gaelic football. Yop Westmeath!
  - Soccerball
  - American football. Go Seahawks!

### This site

My plan is to spend more time working on (completing?) side projects, and _maybe_ write a few blog posts, about said projects or my experiences in IT.
